This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images:  failure to properly resolve dependencies within the Dockerfile. The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) contains an issue related to either a missing `requirements.txt` file, an incorrect path to the `requirements.txt` file or the `app.py` file, or missing dependencies in the requirements file itself. The corrected version (`Dockerfile-fixed`) shows the solution to this problem.  Ensure your dependencies are accurately listed, and double check your paths within the Dockerfile's instructions.
